title: Proof of Stake
subtitle: The failures of a centralized "consensus" mechanism
---

Proof-of-stake is no alternative to [proof-of-work][pow].
When deployed, proof-of-stake will run into failures in the long run, because it has fundamentally flaws that can not be addressed without proof-of-work.

Some recent failures incluce:

- TODO

Read the following to understand why proof-of-stake has and will always fail:

articles that explain why proof-of-stake is a non-solution to the problems that
Bitcoin solves. Also make sure to browse the [rekt leaderboard](https://rekt.news/leaderboard/) to get an idea of the amount of value destroyed and stolen by those who peddle bad ideas.
