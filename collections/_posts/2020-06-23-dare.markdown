Dare to be different. Dare to try something new. Dare to struggle, dare to fail, dare to start anew. Dare to go out into this world, dare to dream, dare to give it your all. Dare to go out on a limb, even if you might fall.

> There are seasons, in human affairs, of inward and outward revolution, when new depths seem
> to be broken up in the soul, when new wants are unfolded in multitudes, and a new and
> undefined good is thirsted for. There are periods when...to dare, is the highest wisdom.
