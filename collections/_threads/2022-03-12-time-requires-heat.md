Ledgers require time, and **time requires heat**. 

It is no accident that the 2nd law of thermodynamics is the only
equation of fundamental physics that knows any difference between past
and future.

Because of this, I am convinced that proof-of-work is the only way to
introduce time into the timeless digital realm.

Everything else relies on external factors and is bound to collapse once
these external factors provide false inputs. 

It goes even deeper than that: The problem of synchronizing clocks is
ultimately an insoluble one. Bitcoin offers a practical solution to this
impossible problem.

You can not solve this problem without introducing a new arrow of time,
a distinction between past and future.

The link between time and heat is fundamental: without heat, a
distinction between past and future is impossible.

Without a distinction between past and future, a ledger - something that
keeps track of things - is impossible. 

Once you understand the profundity of the problem, the beauty of
Bitcoin\'s probabilistic solution becomes obvious.

Synchronization via a difficulty-adjusted proof-of-work is the
innovation. [Bitcoin is Time][time].
