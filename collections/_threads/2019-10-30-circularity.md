\"Circularity\" - A thread about Bitcoin, religion, mirrors, my rabbit
hole journey, and where Bitcoin (and bitcoiners) might go in the next
couple of years.

1/ This is the image I had in my mind when I had what I can only
describe as a religious experience. You might say I went down the deep
end. I would say that I glimpsed behind the mirror.

{% include image.html name="01.png" %}

2/ I drew it in various forms, so the details (e.g. how many outside
circles there are) aren\'t that important. The main idea is important -
at least to me.

{% include image.html name="02.png" %}

3/ The Bitcoin \"rabbit hole\" might look innocuous at first. After all,
you\'re just trying to answer a very simple question: \"What is
Bitcoin?\"

{% include image.html name="03.png" %}

4/ First of all, I believe that falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole is
a deeply personal experience.

5/ The rabbit hole has many entries. Your particular entry point depends
on circumstance, your background, and your previous experience.

Once you are inside, however, you will stumble upon things that are far
removed from your particular point of entry.

6/ Many say that the rabbit hole is bottomless, and I tend to agree. It
certainly feels like a journey without end.

{% include image.html name="06.png" %}

7/ However, I believe that Bitcoin - and the rabbit hole journey - is
circular.

For whatever reason, this insight was of such profundity that it changed
me, my view of the world, and my outlook in regards to the future.

8/ Bitcoin is profoundly circular. It is circular because it is anchored
in nature, via the energy expended in proof-of-work. Some even go
further and conclude the following:

\"Bitcoin is Nature\" \-- [\@FriarHass](https://twitter.com/FriarHass)

9/ You can get stuck in the smaller circles, which is partly why Bitcoin
is so hard to understand. If you are a trader, you might get stuck
trading. Others might get stuck on the whitepaper, or get stuck on
implementation details.

{% include image.html name="09.png" %}

10/ I sometimes drew this image as a mirror, because, well, I believe
that Bitcoin is a mirror - it reflects who you are; it reflects your
beliefs.

\"Bitcoin is different things to different people.\"\
\"Bitcoin is whatever it needs to be\...\"

{% include image.html name="10.png" %}

"Knowledge is a mirror and for the first time in my life I was allowed
to see who I was and who I might become."

{% include image.html name="11.png" %}

12/ The main journey, as I see it now, is roughly as follows:\
Idea -\> Tech -\> Finance -\> Social -\> Cult -\> Idea

{% include image.html name="12.png" %}

13/ There might be multiple stops in-between; that\'s not particularly
important. What is important, is that a cult exists, and some people
will take it to the next level. What is the next level? I think it\'s
Religion.

{% include image.html name="13.png" %}

14/ Up to now, the most powerful ideas have been religious ideas.

Bitcoin fixes this. It combines financial incentives, economic realism,
mathematics, and physics with fundamentalism and religious devotion.
More powerful.

\"Bitcoin religion\" is real. It has already started.

{% include image.html name="14.png" %}

15/ I believe that Bitcoin is the most powerful idea of our time. It is
about to become one of the most powerful memes of our time. I believe
that more and more people will be religious about Bitcoin, about the
idea of separating money and state through absolute scarcity.

{% include image.html name="15.png" %}

16/ Every cycle new bitcoiners are born. Some of these bitcoiners become
maximalists, and some of these maximalists will have religious devotion.

{% include image.html name="16.png" %}

17/ I\'m prepared to be wrong about this.

But I ask you, dear skeptics: are you prepared to deal with tens of
thousands of zealots, in case I\'m right?
