You've heard it before: \"Bitcoin fixes this.\"

It sounds like a joke at first. An off-hand comment uttered by a
complete fool, by someone who is at least partly delusional. Surely,
bitcoin doesn\'t fix *this*? Right?

Many idioms are like that: borderline nonsensical, outrageous, not to be
taken literally. \"Jesus died for our sins.\" \"Live and let live.\"
\"Fix the money, fix the world.\"

It\'s all gibberish. The people who say this stuff aren\'t actually
serious, are they? Surely, it can\'t be true in a literal sense, right?

Consequently, you don\'t take it---or them---too seriously.[^seriously]  You don\'t
think twice about it. You don\'t entertain the possibility of what it *could*
mean or *why* it could be true. 

However, the truth has a way of creeping up on you. And then, one day,
suddenly, it hits you: Bitcoin fixes this. Actually, truly, once and for
all.

### Tyranny

Tyranny. It\'s creeping up again. If we aren\'t careful, it will be
ubiquitous, global, and all-encompassing. Our capacity to yield power
and bring about destruction is almost endless; our wisdom is anything
but. While the end has always been near, I do believe that it truly is
different this time, if just a bit. Our ancestors didn\'t have the
technology to eradicate or enslave all of humanity forever.[^aliens]
In the words of Robert Oppenheimer: \"I am
become death, the destroyer of worlds.\" 

In addition to that, Orwell\'s imaginary boot has been built,
and in some corners of the world, it is stamping on human faces already.
China is the obvious example: social credit scores, total surveillance,
authoritarian rule. But also, the supposedly \"free world\" is not
immune. What is currently happening in Canada is a glimpse of what can
happen to anyone in the [legacy system][dear-legacy] at all times, anywhere on
earth. Join the wrong Facebook[^facebook] group? A visit by the police is in order.
Like the wrong tweet? Gone is your bank account, gone is your insurance,
gone is your credit score. And with it, gone is your ability to
participate in society. Send money to a peaceful protest?
Congratulations, you are no longer a citizen. You are now a terrorist.

This is the world we are already living in, yet most people are still
too preoccupied with trivialities, too blinded by politics, and too
comfortable to care.

I would love to tell you that \"bitcoin fixes this\"---magically, on its
own. It doesn't. It all depends
on [you](https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1462554586829500420?s=20&t=g1j4quHdS6gkLCY2aVKtHQ).

### It\'s All You

There is no magic solution. Yes, Bitcoin is [Magic Internet
Money](https://21-ways.com/3/), but it doesn\'t work
magically on its own. It is *you* that has to participate. It
is *you* that has to care. It is *you* that has to make use of it. It
is *you* that has to stand up, do the work, use the tools, and defend
yourself from those who want to control, [deplatform][busking], cancel, and rob
you. 

You can defend yourself from tyranny, right here, right now. But you
have to put in the work, and you have to do it yourself. I can\'t do the
work for you, and, quite obviously, I can\'t convince you of the
necessity to do so. You can only convince yourself. \"I can only show
you the door. You\'re the one that has to walk through it.\"

This is true for many things, but it is especially true for bitcoin.
Bitcoin held by others is not your bitcoin. Bitcoin verified by others
is not your bitcoin. You have to take ownership. You have to
take [responsibility][responsibility].
You have to become one with the network. You have to care; you have to
decide; you have to believe. You have to form your own opinions of what
bitcoin is and what it might be in the future. You have to be involved. 

There are no shortcuts.

### Participatory Knowing

There is no easy way to explain all of the above to someone. You have
to *experience* it, yourself, for real, with actual skin in the game.
You have to go through the motion of setting up a wallet, holding your
own keys, making backups, recovering from those backups, and so on. You
have to understand some of the nuances of what Bitcoin is and how it
works, not only to understand what you possess---but also to understand
the power that Bitcoin bestows upon you. 

You have to understand beyond the intellectual. You have to participate.
You have to *feel* what it means.

Then, and only then, will you begin to understand why and how \"bitcoin
fixes this.\" I don\'t believe that this realization can come without
experience. The absolute knowledge that your bitcoin is yours and yours
alone---a deep understanding that nobody can forcefully take sats away
from you---has to be experienced to be understood. Once you cross a
border with your net worth in your head---realizing that all your wealth
is contained in these words directly---then, finally, will you begin to
understand the extent and the profundity of it all.

And with it, you will be transformed. And with you, the world. 

### Out Of Chaos, Order

There are rough times ahead of us, no doubt about it. And yet I am
hopeful. In the midst of all the chaos, it is easy to forget that there
is always  [hope](https://www.hope.com/), and love, and
beauty, and the Good. It is easy to forget that 
[chaos][chaos] is
required for order to emerge. 

Do not forget that we have [truth][pow-thread] on our side, and
[love][meme-thread], and [responsibility][responsibility].
I mean all of these things literally, as literal as when I say \"bitcoin
fixes this\" when responding to many a problem of this world. 

-   **Truth:** Bitcoin is the most truthful artifact we have ever had.
    It can not lie to you. Its records are indisputable, especially the
    farther back in time you go. 
-   **Love:** Bitcoin is opt-in. It will never force you to use it. All
    interactions are completely voluntary. It does not coerce. It is
    open, transparent, and welcoming to all. Always. 
-   **Responsibility**: Bitcoin puts the responsibility upon you, and it
    is also responsible in itself: no waste, no unnecessary parts, no
    leakage. A closed-loop monetary base of 21 million, never more. No
    irresponsible bailouts. No handouts to the well-connected. No
    favors, for no one, ever. Everyone is equal in the eyes of Bitcoin.

We are past the \"laugh at you\" stage now. It was clear from the
beginning that *if* Bitcoin grew big
enough, [peacetime](https://twitter.com/dergigi/status/1303264736579121152?s=20&t=VSzDAcNhwAWSEbH_oG8jXQ) would
come to an end, and the powers that be would try to squat it like the
annoying mosquito they think it is. What they don\'t understand,
however, is that Bitcoin is a [different kind of organism][life].
And you, dear bitcoiners, are a crucial part of it. Arm yourself; with
knowledge and freedom-enabling tools alike.

### Going Forward

Bitcoin is a tool that empowers the individual *when used properly*.
Proper use requires education, understanding, care, and participation.
If you are reading this, you probably care enough already. Educate
yourself, and if you can, educate others.

Again: there are no easy solutions. I can\'t recommend one single
article, one book, or one 5-step guide that is one-size-fits-all. You
have to care enough to figure out what works for you, what works for
your friends, your [family][dear-family], your loved ones, your community, and so on. 

That being said, I refer to the following resources often:

May freedom arise like a phoenix out of the ashes. 

Godspeed, and good luck to you all.\\
We\'re going to need it.
