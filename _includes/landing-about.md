Hi, I'm Gigi. \\

I'm a bitcoiner and an Austrian, writing words and [code](https://github.com/dergigi) for Bitcoin. My first
book, 21 Lessons, is one of the most recommended books among bitcoiners. I
launched various projects in the bitcoin space and am currently working on my
second book. My main focus is on privacy, security, free software, open-source
education, and of course: bitcoin. \\
