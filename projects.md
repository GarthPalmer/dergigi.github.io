### 21 Lessons

21 Lessons is a bit of an unusual book. But hey, Bitcoin is a bit of an unusual technology,
so an unusual book about Bitcoin might be fitting. This book came to be because of one
simple question: *What have you learned from Bitcoin?* I tried to answer this question in a
single tweet. Then the tweet turned into a tweetstorm. The tweetstorm turned into an
article. The article turned into three articles. Three articles turned into 21 Lessons. And
21 Lessons turned a book.

### Bitcoin Resources

While falling down the Bitcoin rabbit hole I tried to absorb as much content in the form of
books, articles, and podcasts as humanly possible. Bitcoin Resources is my attempt to
catalog and signal-boost the best and most insightful content in the Bitcoin space. Since
its inception, a growing number of people have started to contribute by selecting and
curating content.

### Bitcoin Quotes

[Bitcoin Quotes](https://www.bitcoin-quotes.com/) is an experiment in micropayments around a
growing collection of Bitcoin-related quotes. As of this writing, 300+ quotes have been
sourced and indexed, in both audio and written form. The source of each quote will be
revealed upon paying ~2Â¢ in sats. I hope that these quotes will inform, inspire, and delight
those who stumble upon them. There is also a rudimentary [API] if you want to integrate
these random quotes into a project of yours.
