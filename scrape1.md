The law, money, and language of Bitcoin

\[TODO: Embed video.\]

Law. Language. Money. The three paradigms of spontaneous and emergent
order in society. Moral questions are at the root of it all:

-   Who should be allowed to speak?
-   Who should be allowed to publish?
-   Who should be allowed to have property?
-   Who should be allowed to defend said property?
-   Who should be allowed to issue and control the money?

It might not be obvious at first, but these questions and their
respective areas - law, language, and money - are all related. They are
related in general, but, more importantly, they are intimately related
in the Gordian knot that is Bitcoin. Allow me, at least for a moment, to
try to untangle this knot. Hopefully, without losing the thread that
makes all of it hang together.

Let\'s begin with the last question: the issuance and control of money.

### Issuance and Control of Money {#Issuance-and-Control-of-Money}

> \"Permit me to issue and control the money of a nation, and I care not
> who makes its laws.\" ---Mayer Amschel Rothschild

As Hayek pointed out in the *Denationalisation of Money*, the government
monopoly on the issuance and control of money is the root of all
monetary evil. \[Footnote / cite\]

If you control the money, you control the purchasing power. Which, in
turn, allows you to control most other things.

This is neither hard to see nor hard to understand: if you can dictate
who gets the money, you can dictate who is well off and who is not. If
you can decide who is allowed to create new money, you can decide who
has to work for money and who gets it unjustly, with the stroke of a pen
or the push of a button.\[1\] If you can control the flow of money, you
can decide who can pay, who can get paid, who can withdraw, who has
access to their bank accounts, and who has access to financial
infrastructure in general. In short: you can decide who will be
deplatformed from society. In the most extreme cases, this is a matter
of life and death. Who gets to eat and who must starve; who gets to
prosper, and who must perish.

This is why questions on the control and issuance of money are first and
foremost *ethical* questions.\[2\] It is a moral problem, not a
technical one.

\[Footnote 1: This injustice is called the \'Cantillion Effect\' and is
especially pronounced in fiat money because fiat money can be printed
out of thin air. For monies like gold or bitcoin, there is no free lunch
since the money is not made up. One has to dig it out of the ground. The
fact that this ground is mathematical, as is the case with Bitcoin,
doesn\'t matter much. If you have to perform work to find new units, the
money is *not* fiat money.\]

\[Footnote 2: Jörg Guido Hülsmann, *The Ethics of Money Production*\]

The nature of money is as multifaceted as it is elusive. Without a deep
understanding of money and an appreciation for its importance, it is
very hard to understand the ethical quandary of money production and
dissemination.

> \"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our
> banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be
> a revolution before tomorrow morning.\" ---Henry Ford

Money can be traded for goods and services. These goods and services are
produced and offered by strangers. The \"stranger\" part is important
because money is the one thing that effectively and peacefully allows us
to scale across trust barriers. With money, you don\'t need to trust
your counterparty - that\'s the whole point. If the counterparty is a
good friend of yours, you can rely on credit. Final settlement is what
removes the trust barrier and allows societies to scale. Without money,
human cooperation has to rely on credit relationships. Everyone has to
remember who owes what to whom. Without an external representation of
these relationships---if everyone has to keep all these ratios in their
head---human cooperation can\'t scale beyond Dunbar\'s Number, resulting
in a maximum group size of about 150 people.

\[Footnote: Nick Szabo, *Money, Blockchains, and Social Scalability*\]

\[TODO: Dunbar Number Image\]

Money, however, is not only used for scalability. It is also used for
measurement. Thus, in the grand scheme of things, money is a measure of
what society owes you. The whole purpose of money is that you can redeem
it for something else, anonymously and with final settlement. Again:
Final settlement means that the deal is done; you are not indebted to
your trading partner anymore. With the exchange of money, the exchange
is final.

Consequently, money is the life-blood of all large-scale economic
activity. The importance of money and the free flow thereof can\'t be
overstated. If we want to live in a free, peaceful, and prosperous
society, we must not interfere with the issue and control of money.
After all, as Frédéric Bastiat famously said, \"When goods do not cross
borders, soldiers will.\"

Fundamentally, there are two ways to get your hands on the things of
strangers: trade and violence. \[Footnote: This includes gifts since you
are trading your gift for reciprocity, karma, a friendly society, or
similar ideas. See Hülsmann, Graeber.\]

The difference between cooperation and conquest is that one interaction
is voluntary, while the other is not. Money not only facilitates and
scales trade, it is also used to express individual preferences and
valuations. How much are you willing to spend for a certain good or
service? Are you willing to spend money at all, or would you rather
save? How long are you willing to hold on to your money? How much are
you willing to invest in certain ventures? Answers to such questions are
expressed in the language of money, which is why the flow of money is
not dissimilar to the flow of information, or speech.

This brings us to the next question. The next two, actually: who should
be allowed to publish? And, who should be allowed to speak?

### Freedom of Speech (and Publication) {#Freedom-of-Speech-(and-Publication)}

> \"Give me the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according
> to conscience, above all liberties.\" ---John Milton

> \"Without free speech no search for Truth is possible; without free
> speech no discovery of Truth is useful; without free speech progress
> is checked, and the nations no longer march forward towards the nobler
> life which the future holds for man. Better a thousandfold abuse of
> free speech than denial of free speech. The abuse dies in a day; the
> denial slays the life of the people and entombs the hope of the
> race.\" ---Charles Bradlaugh

> \"Without an unfettered press, without liberty of speech, all the
> outward forms and structures of free institutions are a sham, a
> pretense---the sheerest mockery. If the press is not free; if speech
> is not independent and untrammelled; if the mind is shackled or made
> impotent through fear, it makes no difference under what form of
> government you live you are a subject and not a citizen.\" ---William
> E. Borah

Countless philosophers, authors, thinkers, activists, freedom fighters,
saints, revolutionaries, and religious leaders have made this point in
the past: freedom of speech, the ability to speak freely without
censorship, is absolutely essential for a free society. We must be able
to identify and speak about problems to have a chance of fixing them.
And, more importantly, we must be able to express our thoughts freely if
we want to think in the first place.

Sound conversations facilitate distributed cognition, much like sound
money facilitates distributed production. And just like the purpose of
money lies in exchange, the purpose of speech lies in dialogue (or
dia-Logos, to use the Vervaekian vocabulary).

> \"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the
> Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God.\" ---Gospel of
> John

There is a reason why *the Logos* is sacred. The divine Word. Speech,
statements, discourse. It is discourse that makes the freedom of
publication a necessity. After all, what use is your right to free
speech if nobody will ever be able to hear you?

The U.S. constitution got this right:

> \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,
> or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of
> speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to
> assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of
> grievances.\" ---First Amendment to the United States Constitution

Freedom of speech. Freedom of the press. It is the first amendment for a
reason, since it is so unbelievably important. If we have free speech,
we have a chance at liberty. If we lack free speech, we have the
certainty of tyranny.

> \"Freedom of speech is the great bulwark of liberty; they prosper and
> die together: And it is the terror of traitors and oppressors, and a
> barrier against them.\" ---Cato, Letter Number 15

> \"Liberty is meaningless where the right to utter one\'s thoughts and
> opinions has ceased to exist. That, of all rights, is the dread of
> tyrants. It is the right which they first of all strike down. They
> know its power. Thrones, dominions, principalities, and powers,
> founded in injustice and wrong, are sure to tremble, if men are
> allowed to reason of righteousness, temperance, and of a judgment to
> come in their presence.\" ---Frederick Douglass

For all our flaws, this is the one thing we got right. The Logos is
sacred, as it should be.

### Bitcoin is Free Speech Money {#Bitcoin-is-Free-Speech-Money}

Why is all of this important in the context of Bitcoin? As myself and
others \[Footnote: Beautyon\] have argued many times before, every
component of bitcoin is text, which makes bitcoin equivalent to speech.
Bitcoin is *Free Speech Money*, both figuratively and literally.

What Bitcoin\'s code facilitates can be understood as a language game,
an ongoing process of publication and rejection. \[Footnote: Warmke, C.
(2021). What is bitcoin?. *Inquiry*, 1-43.\] Miners publish blocks, full
nodes accept or reject said blocks, users publish transactions, ASIC
chips publish hashes of random inputs, and so on. \"It is all text, all
the time,\" as Beautyon has so succinctly put it. Consequently, as he
points out, \"it cannot be regulated in a free country like the USA with
guaranteed inalienable rights and a First Amendment that explicitly
excludes the act of publishing from government oversight.\"

\[Footnote: Why America Can\'t Regulate Bitcoin, Beautyon
https://archive.is/yAOwZ\]

Understanding these fundamentals is important in more ways than one. If
we mistake speech for something which it is not---ammunition, for
example---we run into a conflict with the First Amendment, as
the [Crypto Wars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crypto_Wars) have
clearly shown in the past. Because of the nature of
information, [outlawing
speech](https://dergigi.com/2021/08/02/implications-of-outlawing-bitcoin/) will
always lead to ridiculous consequences, such as illegal numbers, illegal
primes, illegal art, illegal books, illegal sounds, illegal t-shirts,
and all the rest of it. It can also lead to dangerous consequences: if
the stifled information is a warning signal---or some other indication
that something is wrong---error correction can\'t happen.

However, words convey *meaning*, as does information. And this meaning
is and always will be disconnected from the form that said information
takes. Words are pointers, not reality. If you outlaw a certain word,
people will just use something else in its place, something that will
convey the same idea, something that will have the same meaning. This is
also why outlawing any piece of information is not only futile but
ridiculous. Information can take on virtually endless forms.
Consequently, by outlawing a certain piece of information, you
automatically ban books, music, and all other possible representations
of said information, which, depending on your encoding, might
be *anything*. \[Footnote: Goedel numbering\] 

We went through this in the past. The classification of RSA as munition
led to exactly such a conflict of free speech, which is why t-shirts
that have the forbidden information on them were printed in the first
place: to show how ridiculous it all is.

\[TODO: RSA shirt image\]

\[Footnote: Funnily enough, the encoding problem---the disconnect
between the real world and the world of information---is at the root of
the problem of digital money. Bitcoin solves this problem via its
difficulty-adjusted proof-of-work algorithm, which, I believe, is
the *only* way this problem can be solved. In Bitcoin, [the map is the
territory](https://dergigi.com/memeworld).\]

This is precisely why [outlawing
bitcoin](https://dergigi.com/law) unavoidably leads to thoughtcrimes,
illegal numbers, illegal primes, and illegal speech. If publishing a
certain block, nonce, or transaction is ever deemed illegal, the
publication of said block, nonce, or transaction by ways of books or the
press will be illegal too. And because *all aspects* of Bitcoin are
information, having certain thoughts---such as 12 words in your
head---would be illegal too.

Which brings us to the question of enforcement, and the last two
questions of our initial list: Who should be allowed to have property?
And who should be allowed to defend said property?

### Enforcement & Defense of Property Rights {#Enforcement-&amp;-Defense-of-Property-Rights}

In the physical realm, property rights are enforced by violence or the
prospect thereof. It doesn\'t matter much if an individual, the Mafia,
or the State is the ultimate dispenser of this violence. The fact that
there are no unbreakable safes, no unpickable locks, and no unbreakable
glass---in short, no indestructible barriers---requires retaliation if
property is violated.

This raises the question: what exactly constitutes a violation of
property rights? In liberal democracies, the \"trias politica\" of the
state---legislative, judicial, executive---is what tries to answer this
question and resolve disputes. As Bastiat put it, the law exists because
property can be violated, not vice-versa.

> \"Life, liberty, and property do not exist because men have made laws.
> On the contrary, it was the fact that life, liberty, and property
> existed beforehand that caused men to make laws in the first place.\"
> ---Frederic Bastiat, The Law

The fact that physical things are scarce and can be stolen or destroyed
is what brings property rights into existence in the first place.
Property rights are a solution to the potential conflict of who can use
which scarce resource.

The informational realm is very different. Information is non-physical;
it can not be attacked or destroyed directly. As Wei Dai put it in his 
[b-money](https://21-ways.com/1/#b-money-wei-dai-1998) proposal: \"the
threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and
violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to
their [true
names](https://dergigi.com/2020/07/21/true-names-not-required/) or
physical locations.\" 

Information itself doesn\'t have a physical location. The nature of
information is such that information---knowledge---can only be shared,
not stolen. Information has non-scarcity built-in. To distribute
information is to copy it---with perfect fidelity and without sacrifice.
The speaker still retains his knowledge. Consequently, Bitcoin does not
create digital information that can\'t be copied. Such a thing can never
exist.

What Bitcoin does is it creates an infinite game that anyone can join, a
game with certain limitations. These limitations are not unlike the
limitations in a game of chess. The squares on the board are scarce
because everyone wants them to be scarce, not because they can\'t be
copied or modified. We could play a different game with twice as many
squares, but that doesn\'t mean that this game will be played. Like a
game of correspondence chess, Bitcoin is a game of language. A game in
which various players utter phrases to each other that are meaningful to
them individually. Messages are passed back and forth, and participants
do nothing but accept information they deem valid and reject information
they deem invalid. It is Dialogos at its core, utilizing the nature of
information to its advantage, as Satoshi pointed out.

> \"In a nutshell, the network works like a [distributed timestamp
> server](http://dergigi.com/time), stamping the first transaction to
> spend a coin. It takes advantage of the nature of information being
> easy to spread but hard to stifle.\" ---Satoshi Nakamoto

Let me repeat the second sentence for emphasis: Bitcoin takes advantage
of the *nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle*.

We must accept that the nature of information is very different from the
nature of physical objects. While you can own an apple, you can\'t own a
word or a number in any meaningful sense. If you want
to *exclusively* know something, then you must not share it. You must
keep it secret. As George Bernard Shaw so succinctly put it: \"If you
have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange these apples then you
and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have
an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two
ideas.\"

\[TODO: Apple Idea Image\]

These two sentences perfectly encapsulate the problem of digital money.
You can\'t double-spend an apple, but when it comes to information,
there simply is no way to *not* double-spend it. Passing on information
is \"double-spending\" said information, which, coincidentally, makes
the idea of \"digital scarcity\" an oxymoron. Bitcoin does not solve
this oxymoron; it circumvents it. The rules of the game make invalid
information useless, *not* uncopyable. Blockspace is scarce like the
squares on a chessboard are scarce: by social consensus on how the game
is supposed to be played.

The question becomes: how is the game supposed to be played? What are
the rules of the game, and who can change them? Bitcoin\'s *Blocksize
War* was about this question. The resolution of the blocksize wars
showed one thing clearly: in the end, individual users define, verify,
and enforce the rules. The full node is sovereign, as are the users
behind said nodes. \[Footnote: Link to book\]

> \"An apparently overwhelming economic interest group \[wanted to
> change the rules\]---85% of miners, many big-block philosophical
> supporters in exchanges, payment processors, a superficially daunting
> business lobby group---and they lost, because the market prevailed,
> and activist investors said NO. And meant it.\" ---[Adam
> Back](https://twitter.com/adam3us/status/1505101863737307141?s=20&t=a3oT6r6nK54nhVC3f3q40g)

This precedent is important if one wants to understand the various
incentives and dynamics that secure the Bitcoin network. While
enforcement of Bitcoin\'s rules is automated via code, what Bitcoin is
and what it should be---which rules are sacrosanct and which rules might
be changed---is a matter of overlap in individual perception, not
dictate. There is no instance that is in charge of the rules. There are
only players that want to play according to certain rules, and once they
have a way to communicate with each other, the game can be played.

It is important to note, however, that Bitcoin is an
ongoing, *infinite* game. \[Footnote: Link to infinite games book\] It
started with the Genesis Block, and it has been and is being played by
myriads of players ever since. 

The goal of the game is to create an indisputable past in an ongoing
fashion, and it goes something like this:

-   Miners are rewarded with sats to create and protect the past
-   Nodes validate this past, creating the network that pays the miners
-   Users imbue sats with value

Users, nodes, and miners are not exclusive roles. You might be one, two,
or all three.

\[TODO: Governance standoff image\]

The question about what Bitcoin was and what the rules of the game have
been are visible to all. Dispute arises when we want to define what
Bitcoin is and, more importantly, what Bitcoin should be in the future.
Rule agreement happens in the social layer; enforcement happens via
code.

Further, every player is in charge of his own rules. Thus, to introduce
a new rule, you would have to convince every player that your rule is
worthy of adoption. That it is better, fairer, or more fun to play with
your new rule. And if your new rule is incompatible with the game that
we have all played in the past, you will have to
convince *everyone*---otherwise, you will split the game in two,
creating a fork.

By making rule validation part of the ongoing play itself, Satoshi
managed to create a system that is verifiably unchanging. And because
nobody is in charge, you can always choose to play by the original
rules.

> \"The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released,
> the core design was set in stone for the rest of its
> lifetime.\"---Satoshi Nakamoto

This is why the blocksize war was not really a war about block size; it
was a debate about the *soul* of Bitcoin. A dialogue about Bitcoin\'s
future, a disagreement about what Bitcoin is and should be. 

The debate was, in the end, resolved with a chain split. An incompatible
rule change that---because not everyone agreed with the incompatible
change---split the Bitcoin network, and its community of users, in two.

This has happened multiple times since, and it will most likely happen
again. It is an unavoidable consequence of any decentralized game.
Everyone is free to play by their own rules. Everyone is free to fork
off.

### A Strange Loop of Law, Language, and Values {#A-Strange-Loop-of-Law,-Language,-and-Values}

Allow me to revisit the moral questions that we outlined in the
beginning and answer them on my behalf---which is to say Bitcoin\'s
behalf, strangely enough. Because, at least currently, my rules---the
rules that are responsible for enforcing the answers to these
questions---are in consensus with the Bitcoin network.

-   Who should be allowed to speak? Everyone.
-   Who should be allowed to publish? Everyone.
-   Who should be allowed to have property? Everyone.
-   Who should be allowed to defend said property? Everyone.
-   Who should be allowed to issue and control the money? Everyone and
    no one.

The answer to the last question shines light on a common misconception
in Bitcoin: miners are not creating bitcoin; they
are *discovering* bitcoin that already exists in the mathematical space
defined by the protocol. The issuance of bitcoin is [fixed in
time](https://dergigi.com/2021/01/14/bitcoin-is-time/), not computation.
It is pre-determined via the rules of the system and completely
unrelated to its energy expenditure. Issuance and security---and
transaction throughput, for that matter---are completely orthogonal to
each other, as Pierre Rochard \[Footnote: Noded 78, 32:50\] and others
have correctly pointed out in the past.

Above all, the question that is the hardest to grasp for those new to
Bitcoin is the question of *who is in charge of the rules*, which brings
us to a final, crucially important moral question:

-   Who should be allowed to force others to change their rules? No one.

You can\'t force me to play by your rules because I can choose to play
this game how I please. All I need is a way to listen, think, and speak.
And as soon as some other player agrees with my version of the rules, a
networked game can be played.

In the end, this agreement is a question of values---moral values, first
and foremost, but economic values too. Consensus arises if enough people
play by the same rules. For this to happen, players first need to agree
that the game is worthy of being played; that the moral values embedded
in the game are something they value. It is this [idea-value feedback
loop](https://dergigi.com/2019/05/01/bitcoins-gravity/#loop) that brings
economic value into existence.

\[TODO: Idea-value-feedback-loop image\]

Bitcoin is so weird because it does the seemingly impossible: it pulls
itself up from the bootstraps, becoming more valuable and more secure as
time goes on. In short, Bitcoin issues bitcoin to secure itself. The
network brings sats into existence, and it is the value of these sats
that secures the network in turn.

It\'s all interlinked. Sats only exist because the Bitcoin network
exists. The network continues to exist because sats exist *and have
value*.

Bitcoin\'s core rules are \"set in stone\" because of the dynamics of
this ongoing game of words and values. The rules are embedded and linked
to the past; existing players value the rules of the game, or they
wouldn\'t have joined voluntarily in the first place. As we shall see,
value is linked to security, which is probably the most confusing thing
about Bitcoin\'s strange loop of law, language, and money. If we can\'t
rely on trust or violence, we have to rely on mathematics and money.

This is why Bitcoin had to grow like
an [organism](https://dergigi.com/2019/08/07/proof-of-life/) to become
truly resilient. Without a trusted third party, both value and security
have to grow organically over time. This is why Satoshi did not welcome
too much unnecessary attention in the early days. \[Footnote: \"It would
have been nice to get this attention in any other context. WikiLeaks has
kicked the hornet\'s nest, and the swarm is headed towards us.\"
---[Satoshi
Nakamoto](https://satoshi.nakamotoinstitute.org/posts/bitcointalk/542/)\]
It was his responsibility to protect Bitcoin when it was still a
sapling. Bitcoin is not a sapling anymore, but the same forces are still
at play: an endless loop of words and values, protecting themselves by
running the numbers.
